## I. About
Somatic Fusions involving Non-Coding Sequences (SFyNCS) detects fusions involving both protein-coding genes and non-coding sequences from paired-end RNA-seq data. It uses discordant read pairs and split reads to detect the fusions and refine fusion breakpoints to the basepair resolution. Please refer to user manual for more detail.

   ```
   mkdir -p /path_to/star_index_dir

### 3. Input files
  - 3.1. Two paired-end fastq.gz files or fastq files. SFyNCS uses STAR to align reads and use Chimeric.out.junction generated by STAR to call fusion candidates. If users have Chimeric.out.junction prior to running SFyNCS, the STAR alignment step can be skipped, and it can speed up the process significantly.    
    Chimeric.out.junction file can be produced by STAR with following command, please specify /path_to/star_index_dir, number_of_thread and /path_to/star_output_dir in the command:
    ```
    STAR   --genomeDir /path_to/star_index_dir \
           --readFilesIn 1.fastq.gz 2.fastq.gz \
           --readFilesCommand zcat \
           --runThreadN number_of_thread \
           --outFileNamePrefix /path_to/star_output_dir \
           --outReadsUnmapped None \
           --twopassMode Basic \
           --outSAMstrandField intronMotif \
           --outSAMunmapped Within \
           --chimSegmentMin 12 \
           --chimJunctionOverhangMin 12 \
           --chimOutJunctionFormat 1 \
           --alignSJDBoverhangMin 10 \
           --alignMatesGapMax 100000 \
           --alignIntronMax 100000 \
           --alignSJstitchMismatchNmax 5 -1 5 5 \
           --outSAMattrRGline ID:GRPundef  \
           --chimMultimapScoreRange 10 \
           --chimMultimapNmax 10 \
           --chimNonchimScoreDropMin 10 \
           --peOverlapNbasesMin 12 \
           --peOverlapMMp 0.1 \
           --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate \
           --genomeLoad NoSharedMemory
    ```
  - 3.2. Fusion breakpoints from normal samples. They are used to filter out germline events as well as artifacts. We provide fusion breakpoint files from TCGA normal samples. Users can generate their own if RNAseq data from normal samples are available:
     - Generate Chimeric.out.junction for each normal sample (refer to 3.1/II).
     - Format split reads and discordant read pairs information in Chimeric.out.junction.
       ```
       perl /path/to/format_STAR_chimeric_file.pl Chimeric.out.junction >format_chimeric.tsv
       ```
     - Remove duplicated reads and get the number of supporting reads for each breakpoint.
       ```
       perl /path/to/get_juntions_in_normal_sample.pl format_chimeric.tsv >no_duplication_junction_read_count.tsv
       ```
       Example of gene annotation:
       ```
       Column 1:  Chromosome of breakpoint 1 (e.g., chr1)
       Column 2:  Position of breakpoint 1 (e.g., 10005917)
       Column 3:  Strand of breakpoint 1 (e.g., +)
       Column 4:  Chromosome of breakpoint 2 (e.g., chr1)
       Column 5:  Position of breakpoint 2 (e.g., 10005936)
       Column 6:  Strand of breakpoint 2 (e.g., +)
       Column 7:  Breakpoint supported read count (e.g., 1)
       ```
     - Rename each sample’s no_duplication_junction_read_count.tsv and put them under the same directory. Replace “sample_1” with each sample id.
       ```
       mv no_duplication_junction_read_count.tsv sample_1.tsv
       ```
     - Optional: each normal junction file can be compressed.
       ```
       gzip sample_1.tsv
       ```

## III. Example
Note: all files under the example directory are for testing only.
1. Download SFyNCS.
```
git clone https://github.com/yanglab-computationalgenomics/SFyNCS.git
```
2. Decompress example.tar.gz and enter example directory.
```
cd SFyNCS
tar -zxvf example.tar.gz
cd example
```
3. Build STAR index.
```
mkdir star_index
STAR --runThreadN 1 --runMode genomeGenerate --genomeDir star_index --genomeFastaFiles toy_reference_genome_sequence.fasta
```
4. Build TopHat/Bowtie2 index.
```
mkdir -p tophat_index
bowtie2-build toy_reference_genome_sequence.fasta tophat_index/tophat
ln -s $PWD/toy_reference_genome_sequence.fasta $PWD/tophat_index/tophat.fa
```
5. Run SFyNCS. Users should get fusions.tsv.gz and fusions_abridged.tsv.gz under demo_output, please make sure the content in these two output files is the same as the files under example.  
  - 5.1. Start from fastq.gz files.
    ```
    bash ../run_SFyNCS.sh -p 1 -o demo_output -a toy_gene_annotation.gpe -g toy_reference_genome_sequence.fasta -s star_index -t tophat_index/tophat -d toy_normal_directory  toy_pair_end_reads_1.fastq.gz toy_pair_end_reads_2.fastq.gz
    ```  
  - 5.2.  Start from Chimeric.out.junction produced by STAR and fastq.gz files.
    ```
    bash ../run_SFyNCS.sh -p 1 -c Chimeric.out.junction -o demo_output -a toy_gene_annotation.gpe -g toy_reference_genome_sequence.fasta -t tophat_index/tophat -d toy_normal_directory toy_pair_end_reads_1.fastq.gz toy_pair_end_reads_2.fastq.gz
    ```
It will take 1 minute to run the example. Users should get fusions.tsv.gz and fusions_abridged.tsv.gz under demo_output, please make sure the content in these two output files is the same as the files under example.
