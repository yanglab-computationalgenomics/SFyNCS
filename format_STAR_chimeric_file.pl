# 1. Function
# Add "chr" if chromosome is numeral
# Change upstream/downstream position in STAR chimeirc file to breakpoint position
# Format breakpoint strand: + means left or upstream of the breakpoint will be used in fusion, while - means right or downstream of breakpoint
# For a discordant read, sort breakpoints by chromosome if breakpoints locate in different chromosomes
# For a discordant read, sort breakpoints by breakpoint position if breakpoints locate in same chromosome

# to do in next version:
# maybe to do in next version: delete $junc_type=1 if $junc_type!=-1;
# maybe change chrX/chrx to chr23 and chrY/chry to chr24

# 2. Input from chimeric file (taking from star document):
# Every line contains one chimerically aligned read, e.g.:
# chr22 23632601 + chr9 133729450 + 1 0 0 SINATRA-0006:3:3:6387:56650 23632554 47M29S 133729451 47S29M40p76M
# The first 9 columns give information about the chimeric junction. Columns 10-14 describe the alignments of the two chimeric segments, it is SAM like andlignments are given with respect to the (+) strand:
# column 1: chromosome of the donor
# column 2: rst base of the intron of the donor (1-based)
# column 3: strand of the donor (dornor read aligned strand)
# column 4: chromosome of the acceptor
# column 5: rst base of the intron of the acceptor (1-based)
# column 6: strand of the acceptor (acceptor read aligned strand)
# column 7: junction type: -1=encompassing junction (between the mates), 1=GT/AG, 2=CT/AC, 0=any other motif
# column 8: repeat length to the left of the junction
# column 9: repeat length to the right of the junction
# column 10: read name
# column 11: rst base of the rst segment (on the + strand)
# column 12: CIGAR of the rst segment
# column 13: rst base of the second segment
# column 14: CIGAR of the second segment

# 3. Output
# column 1: chromosome of breakpoint 1
# column 2: breakpoint 1 position (1-based)
# column 3: breakpoint 1 strand (different from input strand, + means left of the site will be used, while - means right of site will be used)
# column 4: CIGAR of breakpoint 1
# column 5: chromosome of breakpoint 2
# column 6: breakpoint 2 position (1-based)
# column 7: breakpoint 2 strand (different from input strand, + means left of the site will be used, while - means right of site will be used)
# column 8: CIGAR of breakpoint 2
# column 9: junction type: -1=encompassing junction (between the mates), 1=split reads
# column 10: read name
